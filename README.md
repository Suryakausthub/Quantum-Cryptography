Quantum Cryptography in Smart Grids

Project Overview

This project explores the implementation of Quantum Cryptography, particularly Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), to enhance the security of communication systems in smart grids. As smart grids become more widespread and quantum computing advances, traditional encryption methods such as AES and RSA may become vulnerable. This research investigates the application of quantum cryptography to future-proof smart grids against potential quantum-based cyberattacks.

Motivation

The rapid adoption of smart grids and digital energy systems introduces significant cybersecurity risks. With the emergence of quantum computing, traditional cryptographic protocols could be broken. Quantum Cryptography offers a new way to secure communication by leveraging the laws of quantum mechanics.

Problem Statement
Current cryptographic protocols like AES and RSA may soon become ineffective against quantum attacks. This poses a serious risk to the integrity and functionality of smart grids, potentially leading to power outages or data breaches. This project explores the potential of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) to mitigate these risks and secure smart grid communications.
